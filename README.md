> All images depicting me, or branded graphics designed by me, including but not limited to the Spatchy profile picture and Spatchy logo are to be considered **all rights reserved** and are not to be publicly used, posted or otherwise distributed without explicit written permission from the rights holder. This clause also specifically forbids training of any AI or Machine Learning model on assets to which the clause appies. For the avoidance of doubt, assets to which this clause applies will be contained, where possible, in a folder called `all-rights-reserved`. Note that simply cloning this repository with the intent on using the open source code and assets to which this clause does not apply, is not in itself a violation of this clause.
